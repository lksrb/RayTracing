# RayTracer
This is a basic implementation of a raytracer for me to learn how to create such stuff. Currently only on CPU.

## Getting started
Using Visual Studio 2022 is recommended.

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository**</ins>

Start by cloning this repository using `git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/lksrb/RayTracing`.
This will also download needed dependencies.

<ins>**2. Setting up the project**</ins>

Navigate to `scripts` folder and run [Setup.bat](https://github.com/lksrb/RayTracing/blob/main/scripts/Setup.bat). 
This script will generate ```RayTracing.sln``` into the root folder.
